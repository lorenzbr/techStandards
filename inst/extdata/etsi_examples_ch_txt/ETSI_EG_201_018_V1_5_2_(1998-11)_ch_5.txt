5              impact of interworking situations 5.1            incoming calls from non-isdns in the case of interworking with non-isdns, hlc and llc information elements may be absent, and this interworking is shown with the presence of the progress indicator information element. when this occurs, the terminal should accept the incoming call according to annex b of en 300 403-1 [5], i.e. it should regard the compatibility as successful if it is compatible with the included information, which as a minimum will be the bearer capability information element. 5.2            bc and llc application guidelines in many cases, the same low layer information (e.g., the user rate and the rate adaption technique applied) can be coded in either the bc or the llc information element. however, the provision of information in the one or the other information element has consequences with respect to the selection or the denial of a network provided interworking function. the following guidelines exist for the application of bc and llc information elements according to annex i of en 300 403-1 [5]: type i         information used only at the destination end to allow decision regarding terminal compatibility. this information, if required, shall be coded into octets (3a and) 5 to 7 of the llc information element. type ii        information to permit the network to select the bearer service. this information shall be coded into: -   octets 3 and 4 of the bc information element for circuit-mode traffic.  -   octets 3 and 4, 6 and 7 of the bc information element for packet-mode traffic. type iii       information used by the addressed user to determine terminal compatibility and used by the network to facilitate interworking with other isdns or other dedicated networks. this information is encoded into octet 5 (including octets 5a-5d if appropriate) of the bc information element. these types of information can be used as follows: case 1         if the originating user wishes to transfer information end-to-end to ensure end user compatibility without invoking network interworking, then type i information together with type ii information shall apply. case 2         if the originating user either requires network interworking or is willing to accept network interworking, should it be necessary in order to complete the call, then type iii information together with type ii information shall apply. consequently, if interworking with a pstn, circuit switched public data network (cspdn) or the pan-european mobile cellular system is supported by the network by providing the appropriate functions (i.e. data extraction, modem pool) at the interworking unit, then those calls carrying the rate adaption information in the llc information element may not be successfully completed. these calls will be successful instead, when the rate adaption information is included in the bc information element. terminals shall have the capability to determine compatibility independent of whether the compatibility information is coded in the bc information element (as type iii information) or in the llc information element (as type i information). 12                               eg 201 018 v1.5.2 (1998-11) 63                                eg 201 018 v1.5.2 (1998-11) 7.1.2.2          rate adaption corresponding to ccitt recommendations v.110/x.30
