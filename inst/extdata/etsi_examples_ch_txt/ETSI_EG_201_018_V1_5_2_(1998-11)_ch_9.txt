9              codings in the case where non-isdns are involved 9.1            calls from pstn to isdn a call originated in the pstn, supported by conventional signalling prior to arrival at the isdn interworking point, will belong to one of the three indistinguishable services: -   speech.  or, -   voice band data via modem.  or, -   facsimile group 2/3 service. at the interworking point, the bearer capability '3,1 khz audio' shall be assigned to the call. a progress indicator shall also be applied to mark a non-isdn call source. the following example shows the coding of the compatibility information elements in the case where conventional signalling was applied prior to arrival at the lsdn interworking point. a) bearer capability information element coding: octet                 information element field                                     field value 3        coding standard                                        ccitt standardized coding information transfer capability                        3,1 khz audio (note) 4        transfer mode                                          circuit mode information transfer rate                              64 kbit/s 5        user information layer 1 protocol                      recommendation g.711, a-law 6        user information layer 2 protocol                      ——— 7        user information layer 3 protocol                      ——— note:      the field value 3,1 khz audio is accompanied by a progress indicator. this progress indicator indicates to the isdn terminal that interworking with the pstn has occurred. b) high layer compatibility information element coding: the hlc information element is not present. c) low layer compatibility information element coding: the llc information element is not present. 9.2            calls from pspdn to isdn see itu-t recommendation x.31 [14], subclause 6.2. 9.3            calls from cspdn to isdn see ets 300 103 [2]. 73                           eg 201 018 v1.5.2 (1998-11)
