1               scope the present document provides supplementary information on the usage of the compatibility information elements bearer capability (bc), high layer compatibility (hlc) and low layer compatibility (llc) for individual telecommunication services. it considers the telecommunications services as they are specified for public integrated services digital networks (isdns). it does not specify additional codings of the compatibility information elements which might be required to support the request and provision of telecommunication services by private networks. since some bearer services can be used to support various user applications, additional information on such applications is specified: -   in subclause 7.1 for the circuit-mode 64 kbit/s unrestricted 8 khz structured bearer service.  -   in subclause 7.2 for the circuit-mode 64 kbit/s 8 khz structured 3,1 khz audio bearer service. the specific objective of the present document is to provide guidance on the correct usage of en 300 403-1 [5] codepoints to the different etsi technical committees or technical subcommittees dealing with services, isdn terminals, terminal adapters (tas) and documents on testing. the present document shall help to assure inter- operability of terminals supporting the same telecommunication service and shall enable terminals to operate on different public isdns. the typical codings specified in clause 6 should be supported by all users and networks supporting the corresponding telecommunications service. other variants of these codings may be supported in addition, however, these variants might not provide for world-wide interoperability and might not guarantee terminal interchangeability. the coding examples given in clause 7 are not exhaustive. they illustrate typical user applications involving bit rate adaption schemes where etsi standardized interfaces are used. clause 8 is devoted to examples showing the interworking of european isdns with non-european isdns supporting restricted 64 kbit/s transfer capability. finally, clause 9 presents codings when interworking with non-isdns occurs.
