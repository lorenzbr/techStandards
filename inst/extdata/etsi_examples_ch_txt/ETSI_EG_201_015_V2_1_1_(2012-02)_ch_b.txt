annex b: test suite validation guidelines b.1               introduction the following definitions of validation levels for standardized test specifications have been developed by the etsi centre for testing and interoperability (cti). the intention here is to provide guidance to technical bodies on: •      the selection of a validation level for a particular test suite to be developed.  •      the completion of the validation aspects within the terms of reference (tor) for a specialist task force (stf) to develop the test suite.  and •      the construction of a validation report. b.2               validation levels b.2.1             level 1 validation (basic) b.2.1.1 description the aim of level 1 (basic) validation is to provide reasonable confidence that the test suite is correctly constructed and is capable of executing. the characteristics of level 1 are as follows: •      the test suite has been compiled on at least one ttcn-3 test tool (preferably more than one).  •      the tests have not been executed against real systems under test (sut).  •      no assurance is given that the tests will execute on an industrial test platform.  •      it is anticipated that industry will implicitly validate the execution of the test suite and provide feedback to etsi. the quality of a test suite validated in this way cannot be guaranteed to be high but this can be improved over time with good feedback from industry. level 1 validation can usually be achieved at a relatively low and predictable cost. b.2.2             level 2 validation (strong) b.2.2.1 description the aim of level 2 (strong) validation is to provide reasonable confidence that the test suite is correctly constructed and that it tests the core requirements effectively when executed with a representative system under test (sut). the characteristics of level 2 validation are as follows: •      the test suite has been compiled on at least one ttcn-3 test tool (preferably more than one).  •      the test suite has been executed with a small number of suts (possibly only one sut).  •      it is unlikely that all the tests have run to completion.  •      output traces from the test execution have not been analyzed. 32                       etsi eg 201 015 v2.1.1 (2012-02) level 2 validation raises the quality of the test specifications and gives some assurance that they will compile and execute on an industrial test platform. the costs involved in this level of validation will be greater than at level 1 and, due to the nature of testing, will be more difficult to predict accurately. b.2.3            level 3 validation (rigorous) b.2.3.1 description the aim of level 3 (rigorous) validation is to provide assurance that the complete test suite is correctly constructed and that it tests the full range of requirements effectively when executed in any combination of test system and sut. the characteristics of level 3 are as follows: •      the test suite has been compiled on more than one ttcn-3 tool.  •      the complete suite of tests has been implemented and executed on more than one test platform.  •      the complete suite of tests have been executed against suts from a range of different suppliers.  •      the operation and output traces of all the tests have been validated. level 3 validation guarantees that the quality of the whole test suite will be high but it can add significantly to the cost of the test specifications. b.3              completing the terms of reference the terms of reference (tor) for a specialist task force (stf) to develop test specifications requires the following information to be included: •      the extent of validation of the test specifications.  •      the division of responsibilities.  •      the cost of validation. b.3.1            the extent of validation a declaration should be made of the validation level (see clause b.2) that is intended to be used within the project. this should include an assessment of the risk that the given level of validation may not be achieved. it should also specify how the declared validation level is to be achieved by identifying the following: •      full details on the validation process.  •      a list of test equipment and/or platforms required.  •      the availability of suitable suts to test against etc.  •      a timeline for completing the task(s), noting all critical activities.  •      details of the resources from outside the etsi funded work program that will be provided by committee members.  •      assurances that the external resources will be made available when they are required.  and •      the methods that will be used for providing feedback to the responsible technical committee. 33                         etsi eg 201 015 v2.1.1 (2012-02) b.3.2          responsibilities details should be provided of where responsibilities lie for the provision of resources (both human and equipment) and how those resources are to be used. this should clearly indicate: •     which tasks are to be undertaken by the members of the stf itself.  •     which tasks are to be undertaken by experts outside the stf.  •     which tasks are to be performed jointly by stf experts and external experts.  and •     where each task is likely to be carried out (particularly if not at etsi's own offices). each validation level carries its own overlapping set of responsibilities that need to be considered and these are identified in table b.1. table b.1: responsibilities associated with each level of validation rigorous validation (level 3) strong validation (level 2) basic validation (level 1) provision of ttcn-3 analyser/compilers compilation of the test suite reporting of errors in the tools reporting of errors in the ats updating of ats compilation of

output traces b.3.3          costs associated with validation an estimate of the cost of the validation tasks should be provided in terms of effort, travel and equipment costs (for example, hire charges, insurance and transport). this information should be included in the overall total of the stf. each level of validation implies a different level of expense to be considered. these are summarized in table b.2. 34                           etsi eg 201 015 v2.1.1 (2012-02) table b.2: validation cost considerations validation level                                            costing information basic validation                                          •   low cost.  •   easily calculated depending on: - the size and complexity of the test suite.  and - the number of compilers that will be used. strong validation                                         •   reasonable cost.  •   more difficult to estimate.  •   depends on: - the number of tests validated.  - the maturity of the test suite.  - the complexity of the test suite.  - the number of compilers that will be used.  and - the number of suts expected to be used. rigorous validation                                       •   higher cost.  •   difficult to estimate accurately.  •   depends on: - the size and complexity of the test suite.  - the maturity of the test suite.  - the number of compilers that will be used.  - the number of suts expected to be used.  and - the equipment and other resources required for the validation exercise. b.4            the validation report once the validation of a test suite has been completed it is necessary to produce a report detailing the results of the validation exercise. there is no specific requirement for the report to be made available in any particular form but in most cases it can be usefully placed as an annex to the ats technical specification (ts) document. the amount of information included in the validation report will depend on the validation level chosen. however, all validation reports should include the following: •     an indication of the validation level achieved.  •     a declaration of the edition of the ttcn-3 standard that the test suite was based upon.  •     for each ttcn-3 tool used: -     identification of the ttcn-3 tool: supplier.  tool name.  version.  configuration settings.  and other tool-specific information.  -     compilation status: overall success or failure.  details of compilation failures including justifications for accepting them if necessary.  •     non standard modifications to the test suite: -     details of any use of non-standard ttcn-3 within the test suite with justifications for its inclusion.  35                        etsi eg 201 015 v2.1.1 (2012-02) •     ttcn-3 quality: -     if the ttcn-3 has been analyzed with the etsi t3q quality assessment tool then a copy of the t3q configuration file and details of the results of the analysis should be included here.  •     validation method: -     a brief description of the validation process followed. if the validation level was either strong (level 2) or rigorous (level 3) then the following additional items should be included in the validation report: •     for each test platform used, an indication of: -     the manufacturer.  -     the product name.  -     any version or revision information.  -     other useful product-specific information.  •     for each sut used in the validation, an indication of: -     the manufacturer.  -     the product name.  -     any version or revision information.  -     other useful product-specific information.  •     validation status of the test suite: -     for each tests case executed: a test case identifier.  the verdict achieved at the end of validation.  the implication on the validation of the test suite of each verdict regardless of whether 'pass', 'fail' or 'inconclusive'.  activities required, if any, to correct the test suite. 36                 etsi
