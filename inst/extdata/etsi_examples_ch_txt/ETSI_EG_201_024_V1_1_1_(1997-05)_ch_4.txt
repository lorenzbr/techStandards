4              design issues relating to network management applications network management application design issues are often specific to the domain due to the nature and requirements of telecommunication systems that are very different from those associated with word processing, for example. the key issues are: -   the time critical nature of telecommunication network management uis.  8                                 eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) -   the need for a rigorous approach to ensure errors do not go undetected.  -   users handle large volumes of data in real time (ansi t1.232 [1]).  -   handling multiple object types in a complex application environment. 4.1             time criticality the design of a fault management application should take into consideration that networks are real time systems. when system faults do occur they may be crucial to the continued operation of a sub-network or service and therefore demand immediate attention. it is essential that such information is proactively raised by the functional system and highlighted at the user interface for the attention of the network operator. this shall be done in a way that it minimizes the need for searching, reduces cognitive overload and optimizes user response time. 4.2             rigorous approach because of the real time and complex nature of telecommunication networks, care should be taken in defining a coherent metaphor that matches the user's view of the tasks they need to perform. for example the metaphors based on a clerical interaction concepts such as 'desktops', 'folders', etc. may be of restricted use in this environment. within networks carrying large amounts of traffic a failure to highlight a key fault could result in large areas of the network being taken out of service. 4.3             large volumes of real time data network control centres can be likened to traffic control centres where from time to time large numbers of apparently isolated events may occur. providing the user with assistance in prioritizing, filtering and managing these external asynchronous inputs is paramount in the design of effective network control applications. 4.4             handling multiple objects typical network control applications for say configuration could encompass: central office switches, sdh equipment and, increasingly broadband access and atm switches, together with a whole range of equipment within a network that can have diverse functionality and capabilities. as an entity they form the network and as such providing ways to deal with such complexity is essential. 4.5             experience in the operations domain today many people are familiar with applications such as word processing and drawing packages. however, very few will have had the opportunity and insight gained by controlling an operations network in an on-line environment where it is required to handle 'live' problems and events. a full understanding of the requirements for network management requires many years of experience. developers may not have this experience, however, this disadvantage can be overcome by adopting a user-centred approach in which all stake holders, including representative network operator staff are involved.
