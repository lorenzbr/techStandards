4               validation overview any standard is a collection of requirements which, if implemented correctly, achieve certain objectives in a product. these requirements could specify physical characteristics such as length, voltage and accessibility or behaviour such as the interchange of messages and the responses to particular stimuli. the purpose of validation is to ensure as far as possible that the requirements expressed in the standard do, in fact, meet the objectives. the objectives against which a standard may be validated may come from a variety of sources and cover a number of different aspects within the standard. these can include: •     technical objectives related to the technology standardised: -     the extent to which the requirements can be realized by products.  •     editorial objectives: -     the ease with which the requirements can be read and understood.  -     the extent to which the requirements are expressed unambiguously.  -     the accuracy of references to other standards. the objectives against which a standard is measured can be validated either directly by, for example, reviewing the specification itself, or indirectly by, for example, evaluating the performance of an implementation of the standard. 25                         etsi eg 201 015 v2.1.1 (2012-02) 6.3.2.2             test suite structure the tss defines the grouping of tests in the test suite to be developed. it is usually specified as a tree of nested groups of tests and its structure will depend on the nature and properties of the standard to be tested. for example, the structuring into valid and invalid test cases on a 'per feature' basis could be used for protocol testing [i.15]. the development of the tss requires close inspection of the functional grouping of requirements (such as normal and exceptional behaviour) specified in the base standard and can help in checking that they are well-defined.
