shown in this subclause are based on the assumption that this service requires two connections with 64 kbit/s transfer capability each. if the videotelephony call requires only one 64 kbit/s connection, then the coding example of the first connection applies. this subclause only covers the isdn videotelephony teleservice as specified in ets 300 264 [4]. other audiovisual services such as

shows the codings as they are finally required for the support of the videoconference teleservice as specified in ets 300 267 [18]. subclause 6.3.9.2 provides codings additionally to those of subclause 6.3.9.1. these codings can be used when networks are involved in videoconference calls, which, for an interim period of time, do not support the videoconference teleservice i.e. these networks do not support either or both the bc coding 'unrestricted digital information with tones/announcements' and the fallback procedure. 6.3.9.1              codings required for the service specified in ets 300 267 the codings shown in this subclause are based on the assumption that this service requires two connections with 64 kbit/s transfer capability each. if the videoconference call requires only one 64 kbit/s connection, then the coding example of the first connection applies. this subclause only covers the isdn videoconference teleservice as specified in ets 300 267 [18]. other audiovisual services such as audiographic conference service and audiovisual interactive service are not covered in this subclause. 6.3.9.1.1        first connection if the calling terminal allows fallback to occur to an alternative bearer capability and high layer compatibility, then the terminal shall indicate this to the network by means of repeated bc and hlc information elements within the setup message. a) to indicate that a videoconference teleservice is required with fallback allowed to telephony 3,1 khz, the user shall set: -    the first hlc information element included in the setup message to 'telephony'.  and -    the second hlc information element as specified in this subclause.  and -    the first bc information element included in the setup message to 'speech' as specified in subclause 6.3.1.  and -    the second bc information element as specified in the following example. b) to indicate that a videoconference teleservice is required with fallback allowed to telephony 7 khz, the user shall set: -    the first hlc information element included in the setup message to 'telephony'.  and -    the second hlc information element as specified in this subclause.  and -    the bc information element as specified in this subclause. it shall be present only once. if the calling terminal does not allow fallback to occur, then only one bc and one hlc information

6.3.10.1 shows the codings as they are finally required for the support of the audiographic conference teleservice as specified in ets 300 267 [18]. subclause 6.3.10.2 provides codings additionally to those of subclause 6.3.10.1. these codings can be used when networks are involved in audiographic conference calls, which, for an interim period of time, do not support the audiographic conference teleservice i.e. these networks do not support either or both the bc coding 'unrestricted digital information with tones/announcements' and the fallback procedure. 6.3.10.1            codings required for the service specified in ets 300 267 the codings shown in this subclause are based on the assumption that this service requires two connections with 64 kbit/s transfer capability each. if the audiographic conference call requires only one 64 kbit/s connection, then the coding example of the first connection applies. this subclause only covers the isdn audiographic conference teleservice as specified in ets 300 267 [18]. other audiovisual services such as video conference service and audiovisual interactive service are not covered in this subclause. 6.3.10.1.1 first connection if the

setup message to 'speech' as specified in subclause 6.3.1.  and 46                                 eg 201 018 v1.5.2 (1998-11) -   the second bc information element as specified in the following

in f.400 [19]. subclause 6.3.11.2 provides codings additionally to those of subclause 6.3.11.1. these codings can be used when networks are involved in multimedia calls, which, for an interim period of time, do not support the multimedia teleservice i.e. these networks do not support either or both the bc coding 'unrestricted digital information with tones/announcements' and the fallback procedure. 6.3.11.1             codings required for the service specified in f.700 the codings shown in this subclause are based on the assumption that this service requires two connections with 64 kbit/s transfer capability each. if the multimedia call requires only one 64 kbit/s connection, then the coding example of the first connection applies. this subclause only covers the isdn multimedia

unrestricted digital information, then this information element may be present with octets 3 and 4 identical to the bc information element content and octet 5 specifying 'recommendations h.221 and

conflict shall be resolved in favour of the bc information element, i.e. the conflicting information in the llc information element shall be ignored. note:       the llc coding of 'recommendation h.221 and h.242' in conjunction with the bc coding given in subclause 8.2 do not represent a conflict.
