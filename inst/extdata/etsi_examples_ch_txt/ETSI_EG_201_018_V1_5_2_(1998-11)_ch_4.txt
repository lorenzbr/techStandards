4               general principles applicable to all services for all services, the following principles apply: a) the llc information element is transferred transparently through an isdn between the calling entity and the addressed entity. however, dependent on the charging principles applied, some networks may perform checks on the length of the llc information elements.  b) the hlc information element is transferred transparently through an isdn between the calling entity and the addressed entity. however, some networks may check its content, e.g., to associate a supplementary service to a teleservice.  c) where bearer services are specified, the hlc information element will normally not be present unless they are used to support high layer applications.  d) the coding examples consider the general case. in special terminal arrangements the user may need to rely on address information only. in these cases the multiple subscriber number (msn) supplementary service shall be used.  e) a terminal equipment type 2 (te2) together with a ta are assumed to provide the same functionality as a terminal equipment type 1 (te1). therefore, a ta should not generate and send a progress indicator when setting-up a connection. consequently, a ta, e.g., adapting a two-wire analogue public switched telephone network (pstn) user-network interface to the isdn user-network interface will generate the bc and, if appropriate, the hlc and llc information elements in accordance with the type of equipment it serves at the interface at the r reference point, namely: bc-/hlc-/llc-codepoints used at an interface at the coincident equipment connected to an interface                                      s&t reference point at the r reference point                          bc                      hlc                   llc analogue telephone                                  speech                  telephony facsimile group 2/3 equipment                       3,1 khz audio           facsimile group 2/3 voice band data equipment via modem                 3,1 khz audio                                  modem type for the presentation of the coding examples, the following conventions apply: -   octets 1 and 2 of the compatibility information elements, indicating the information element identifier and length respectively, are omitted from the considerations and therefore not shown in the examples.  -   a dash instead of a field value indicates: a) at the calling side: this field is not included in the information element.  b) at the called side: this field is not present.  -   field values in brackets ( ) may or may not be included at the calling side and therefore not be present at the called side. 11                               eg 201 018 v1.5.2 (1998-11) 26                                eg 201 018 v1.5.2 (1998-11) 6.3.3.3.1            request by a calling terminal a) bearer capability information element coding: octet                 information element field                                       field value 3     coding standard                                        ccitt standardized coding information transfer capability                        unrestricted digital information 4     transfer mode                                          packet mode information transfer rate                              00000: packet mode 5     user information layer 1 protocol                      ——— 6     user information layer 2 protocol                      recommendation x.25, link layer 7     user information layer 3 protocol                      recommendation x.25, packet layer b) high layer compatibility information element coding: the hlc information element is not included. c) low layer compatibility information element coding: the llc information element is not included.
