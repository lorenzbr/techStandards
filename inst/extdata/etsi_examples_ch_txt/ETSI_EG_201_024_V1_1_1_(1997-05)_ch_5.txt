5               key network management design principles this clause presents the design principles that should be applied to graphical user interfaces used for accessing and controlling telecommunications management networks. 5.1             match functionality to the users' view in the domain of tmn it is an essential requirement for the functionality provided in the interface to match closely to the users view and understanding of the management tasks. this principle has implications for both the type of functions provided for the user to perform their tasks and also the means with which they can access that functionality. 9                               eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) an approach that is widely adopted is the internationally recognized osi 7 layer model for network management provides a list of five key user management task groupings within its application layer, see itu-t recommendation x.700 | iso/iec 7498-4 [4]. the users task groupings are defined as: -   faults management.  -   configuration management.  -   accounts management.  -   performance management.  -   security management. this grouping is commonly known as fcaps. adopting these categories as key functions within tmn systems can be beneficial as they are becoming well defined, are comprehensive, and may be applied across osi and non osi networks. in addition, these functions are widely accepted within the industry and can be considered as an important constituent of the user's view of the network management task. under the individual fcaps menu bar heading, related functional groupings that match the users view of the network can be partitioned to effect management of the network. for example, in figure 1, the alarm monitor, fault verification, trouble reports and testing functions are grouped under the faults menu item. adopting such partitioning benefits the users in terms of reduced search and learning times as they know at a glance where to access key functionality. reference is made to annex a of the present document that outlines an approach that could be used to determine functional groupings and thereby enable provision of categories of user tool sets with appropriate partitioning. note:      in the future with the ever changing technologies and services that may be run over telecommunication networks alternative approaches to the fcaps scenario may evolve, however, it is considered that the high level principles contained within the present document should remain applicable. figure 1: the fcaps menu bar 5.2             avoid information overload the task of managing telecommunications networks is highly complex. with networks generating many thousands of events per hour, significant quantities of information need to be absorbed and processed by the user before decisions can be made and appropriate actions initiated. one means of assisting the user in this complex task is to reduce the quantity of information to be absorbed by simply not presenting unnecessary and irrelevant information, or to filter out information that is not needed within a given context. 10                               eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) for example, when presenting a high level graphical overview of the network to a user performing a monitoring task, the key information elements required are a representation of the network elements, their status and some illustration of their geographical relationship and an indication of any alarms (see figures 2 and 3). whilst figure 2 presents the network elements, their geographical location and relevant alarm warnings, the level of geographical detail overloads the user with information which serves only to dilute the visibility of the alarm indicator. a clearer representation is given by figure 3 without the loss of any information necessary for the users to perform their task. figure 2: an example of information overload 5.2.1           telescoping in place the task of network management can be further assisted by minimizing the amount of user navigation required to access relevant information. where it is clear from the task context in which the user is currently operating, then wherever possible, key information that would assist the user, should be brought automatically to the user level. an example is shown in figure 3 where a nodal alarm is automatically highlighted without requiring user action to locate it. the action of presenting key related information at the user level , without the need for user action is known as 'telescoping in place'. in this example, the 'balloon icon' attachment to the original icon outline could be further elaborated to include details of the critical nature of the alarm. figure 3: an example of the use of telescoping to reduce overload 11                            eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) 5.2.2           flattening the hierarchy in the example shown in figure 4, the user has to chase alarm indicators through a number of logical windows, equipment views and alarm lists in order to obtain important information. in figure 5, the key information relating to, in this case fault information, but equally applicable to other network management functions, has been combined and located within a single window. the principle of combining relevant information and presenting it within a single window as shown in figure 5 is an example of flattening the hierarchy. figure 4: an example of a too deep hierarchy figure 5: an example of a flatter hierarchy 12                                eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) 5.3           redundant coding when important information needs to be brought quickly to the user's attention then the principle of changing multiple coding dimensions (often termed redundant coding) may be applied. changing the graphical representation of an element in more than one dimension, e.g. colour, shape, location, size will make the element attract the users attention more easily than if only one dimension is altered (see figure 6). adopting this strategy will also help cater for users with colour vision deficiencies and for changes in ambient lighting conditions. figure 6: an example of redundant coding 13                              eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) 5.4            allow users to customize the interface it should be recognized that the etsi area of influence is not only limited to the european union but extends to many countries in the world, with their own languages and culture and hence there can be a need to customize the interface design to suit the local requirements. to accommodate the requirements of the national perspectives as well as the 'global' perspective consideration should be given to the issues mentioned below: -  communicate in the native language.  -  support the natural writing symbols, punctuation's etc..  -  support native formats for date, currency, weights, scales, numbers and addresses.  -  support natural work habits and the environment.  -  communicate in a natural and inoffensive manner.  -  sensitivity to the target culture. note:      this is by no means a complete list, its aim is to raise awareness of some likely issues, see 'global interface design' [5]. an example of how user preferences can be accommodated within predefined limits for colour, text style, font size and sound, is shown in figure 7. figure 7: an example of interface customization 14                                eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) 5.5             colour sensitivity to the colour association of different cultures, can be important. table 2 lists a set of symbolic associations with colour that apply in western culture. however, it should be noted that even within a culture a given colour may have various interpretations e.g. red may signify, fault, take priority action, or 'danger power on' depending upon the application context, hence, rather than use the table as a definitive statement it is far better to use the colours consistently, thereby enabling users to learn associations with colour (see 'effective colour displays, theory and practice' [6]). table 2: colour associations in western cultures concept                  colour            percentage association stop                     red                        100 go                    green

5.5.1           colour usage colour is useful for attracting a user's attention.  it can increase the salience of an object. colour is also useful for conveying information (i.e. coding) because it is effortlessly processed by people: -   in surveillance tasks, muted colours shall be used for steady state displays. objects in this state should appear to blend into the background, while remaining visible to the user.  -   objects which contain task relevant information or new critical information should be displayed using redundant coding techniques.  -   displays should limit the of colours that are presented in the foreground. as a rule of thumb, four different hues can be displayed simultaneously without overloading the display.  -   the background for a graphical display of information that is important to a users task and that contains coloured objects, such as the area within the outline of a network map, should facilitate distinguishing objects and their colours in the foreground.  -   in the selection of colours for backgrounds and for the middle and foreground elements, the maximum contrast ratios should be reserved for those elements in the foreground. for example, black text on white ground provides a high contrast ratio and in general optimizes visual processing. actual contrast is dependent on the display device being used.  -   the backgrounds for windows of an application should be the same hue (but may vary in saturation) to facilitate user recognition of their relationship. 15                              eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) 5.5.2           colour coding when colour coding is used the designer should consider the following points, see also 'effective colour displays, theory and practice' [6]: -  discrimination.  -  detectability.  -  perceptual equality of coding steps.  -  meaningfulness.  -  consistency.  -  aesthetics. 5.5.2.1             discrimination it is necessary that the colours can be discriminated from each other by the predicted group of users. this can best be achieved by aiming for a large luminance contrast between the foreground and the background, e.g. light green on a dark blue background. it is also advisable to use colours that are 'pure' in their group for areas used to convey key information. for example, red should be a true red rather than slightly orange or brown. 5.5.2.2             detectable the chosen colours should be detectable by the predicted user group under the ambient illumination of the network management control room. consideration should also be given to the possibility of some users being colour blind, e.g. around 8 % of males have red-green discrimination problems, see 'effective colour displays, theory and practice' [6]. 5.5.2.3             perceptually equal steps the discrimination steps between the chosen colours should appear approximately the same. if a set of say five colours is chosen in a user interface representation, then if two or more of those colours are similar, those colours will be associated together, whether or not they are intended to represent the same functionality. 5.5.2.4             meaningful the code should have relevance to the user. for example, red may well represent a major failure condition within the network that requires immediate attention, whereas yellow may signify a less urgent situation that is not catastrophic and can be dealt with at a later date. 5.5.2.5             consistency if the 'major fault' option for example is coded in red on one screen, then it should be coded in red for all screens. moreover, the colour should be 'reserved' once it has been claimed for an option i.e. used only in that context. 5.5.2.6             aesthetics to be aesthetically pleasing use as few colours as possible and ensure that the chosen colours do not clash, causing the display to look garish and unattractive. an aesthetically well designed display will help users perform their task and assist in their ability to use it for many hours at a time. 16                               eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) 5.6              dialogue considerations it is good practice to ensure that dialogue boxes have space available to accommodate non english text, assuming of course that the initial development has taken place in english: -  check out appropriate font - standard fonts vary with locale.  -  leave space for text expansion, due to different language usage - do not use abbreviations (see table 3 extrapolated from 'software internationalization and localization: an introduction' [7]).  -  layout and orientation of screen objects may differ. table 3: examples of space requirements for translations number of             allocate an characters in           additional english           character space 1 - 10                200 % 11 - 20                100 % 21 - 30                 80 % 31 - 50                 40 % 71+                   30 % 5.7              symbols whilst it is recognized that some network operators may require variants of given graphical symbols or icons to accommodate specific local needs, in the interests of consistency to facilitate interoperability between different suppliers, it is recommended that use is made of the symbols as defined in ansi t1.232 [1] to define the type or class of network elements being referenced, for example, switching, transport and transport add drop (see annex b). examples of how these symbols could be used within given icons to maintain consistency and good user recognition are shown in figure 8. it is recommended that all icons should undergo a usability evaluation, such as that defined in etr 070 [8], to determine suitability for task. switch                        transport                      transport add-drop figure 8: examples of the use of symbol elements within a network element icon 5.8              establish a consistent and complete visual language a visual language is akin to a spoken one in that it empowers users to comprehend abstract events and objects through a clear and unambiguous taxonomy and lexicon. 17                                 eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) 5.8.1           rationale the visual language presented by the user interface is critical to the effectiveness and efficiency of the users. language systems consist of two components: -   vocabulary.  and -   grammar. vocabulary is the collection of elementary symbols, for example, letters and words. grammar is the collection of rules used to combine symbols. people will respond to good visual design in specific and measurable ways. in particular the system and tasks will be easier to understand, easier to learn, and will be more engaging. 5.8.2           design implications a) contrast: -   if elements are the same, make them look the same. if elements are different, make them look different. b) repetition: -   create a series of common visual threads to tie the interface together by repeating one or more elements throughout. c) alignment: -   every element should have a visual connection to another element. do not position elements arbitrarily. d) proximity: -   physically group related elements. e) apply the above - contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity, in a consistent way to the following visual attributes: -   position, size, shape, colour, texture, composition, viewpoint, depth, and style. in addition to the node classification shown in figure 8 the description of the states associated with a given network element should encompass the operational, usage or administration state as defined in iru-t recommendation x.731 | iso/iec 10164-2 [9]. 5.9             network views the structure of network management systems varies from organization to organization according to such factors as their size and network coverage. typically, however, such networks incorporate a centralized control centre linked to local regional centres. staff within the centres are often responsible for specific tasks, e.g. performance monitoring and management, fault management and configuration. to support given tasks contextual information can be usefully provided by the use of geographic, logical and physical views of the network and network elements as follows: -   high level map.  -   local detailed map.  -   local view.  -   racking system view.  -   shelf view.  -   concurrent views. 18                              eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) 5.9.1          high level map view at operational control centres it is often required to have a view of the network that can be used, for example, to monitor overall network status and includes the geographic location of the regional centres. again, applying the principle of avoiding information overload only sufficient information should be presented to the operator that is useful and informative. this could be as simple as indicating network management centres that are located locally, where the icons could also be used to indicate status e.g. operational, non operational, alarm, etc. a plethora of interconnection lines between the various management centres as seen in some designs is not to be recommended and should be used with care. an example is shown in figure 9. figure 9: an example of a high level geographic view 19                           eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) 5.9.2          local detailed map view in situations such as fault management or configuration management it can often prove useful to present a detailed map of the local area network. here again the emphasis should be to present key information that allows the task to be simply and easily accomplished. in the example in figure 10, the geographic location of network interconnections are shown in relation to roads and urban development. the user should be able to navigate the map freely and control the level of detail to be shown in a manner that is pertinent to their task. figure 10: an example showing a detailed geographic view 20                              eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) 5.9.3         logical view alternative forms of presentation to the physical view in figure 10, can be provided such as the logical view of the local network as shown in figure 11. logical views can show relationships between network elements with clarity in situations where a geographic view does not add value. figure 11: an example of a logical view 21                               eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) 5.9.4          racking systems representations in situations such as configuration, or where network faults have occurred, it can be useful to enable the network management operator to focus down on the physical equipment utilized in the network. an example is shown in figure 12. figure 12: an example of a racking system representation 22                                eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) 5.9.5          shelf view again, when configuring the network or checking for a fault location, a physical view of the shelf housing circuit cards can be useful in providing on line information to the central network operator of the shelf status. in the example given, the dark grey shaded areas indicated unused positions for the location of circuit cards (see figure 13). figure 13: an example of a shelf view 23                                eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05) 5.9.6           concurrent views to ensure users can maintain a suitable context within complex tasks they should be allowed to generate multiple concurrent views of the network paths or elements. this is particularly useful for instance when the user is locating faults. in this case a user can benefit by having the ability to view details of several related network paths or elements at the same time, whilst maintaining an overall view of the network. the use of multiple views will minimize short term memory loading thereby reducing the possibility of errors. an example is shown in figure 14. some implications on the design of concurrent views are as follows: -   default parameters for window sizes and locations should be designed such that newly opened windows should not completely cover the previous frame.  -   it should be possible to have open several different views of the network at the same time, however, care is needed to avoid screen overload. figure 14: an example of a concurrent view 24                              eg 201 024 v1.1.1 (1997-05)
